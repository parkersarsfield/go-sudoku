Installing and Using Go:
Navigate to this website https://golang.org/doc/install and after installing, use “go run sudoku.go” to compile and run our sudoku.go file. No specific configuration should be necessary.

Input:
Our sudoku test file (named “sudokutest.txt”) is hard-coded into our solver. The sudoku input format is a 9x9 matrix of integers separated by spaces with no trailing whitespace.

Screenshot of solver:
A screenshot of our solver completing a sudoku solver is included in our directory and is named “solver_screenshot.png”
